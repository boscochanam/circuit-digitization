# 🚨 READ THIS FIRST — Critical Preprocessing Steps

The wire detection pipeline **WILL NOT WORK** without these three preprocessing steps. Many AI agents skip them and produce garbage results.

## MANDATORY Preprocessing (in order)

### 1. HDC Label Matching
Each image needs YOLO-OBB component labels from roboflow_test2. Match by pixel-difference.
- Paths: `/home/claw/circuit-digitization/roboflow_test2/{train,valid,test}/labels/`
- Images: `/home/claw/workspace/ground_truth/labels_few_annot/images/`

### 2. Component Occlusion  
Fill each component polygon with **local median color** (NOT white, NOT black — use `np.median()` of local region).
- Margin: 15% of bbox size, min 5px
- This removes text, component edges, internal structures

### 3. ROI Crop + Padding
Crop to union of all component bounding boxes + 10px padding in all directions.
- This removes scanner border artifacts and paper edges
- Remember to add the offset (rx1, ry1) back to all detected line endpoints

## Pipeline Params (DO NOT CHANGE)
- Sauvola: k=0.30, window=51
- Close: ellipse 3×3
- CCL: min_area=20
- Dedup: angle=10°, dist=18px  
- **NO merge, NO length filter** — both destroy TPs

## Reference Implementation
Run: `uv run python wire_detection/benchmark/reference_pipeline.py`
Expected output: F1=0.7066, TP=248, FP=70, FN=52

## Common Errors Agents Make
1. ✗ Skipping occlusion entirely → FP count explodes
2. ✗ Filling with white (255) instead of median color → edges become wires
3. ✗ Not cropping to ROI → scanner borders detected as wires  
4. ✗ Forgetting coordinate offset after crop → lines in wrong position
5. ✗ Using merge or length filter → 64 TPs destroyed
6. ✗ Using old params (otsu, dilate=5, min_area=30, dedup_dist=12) → wrong pipeline
7. ✗ Not matching HDC labels → no occlusion at all
